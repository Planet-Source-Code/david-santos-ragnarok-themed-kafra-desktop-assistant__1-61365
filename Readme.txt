Intro
==========================
[Kafra]
Welcome to Kafra Corp! We will stay with you wherever you go!

Kafra Desktop Assistant is a nifty little cute desktop app for all you 
Ragnarok fans featuring all the cute Kafra from Ragnarok Online.

KDA is still much under development so I'd appreciate any ideas, just 
send 'em over to <saintender.geo@yahoo.com>

For those who'd like to know, I used to Rag on pRO as Nadia Fensworth,
the merchant who used to OC/DC outside Prontera Culverts, usually dealing
in Insect Feelers and Worm Peelings.

Thanks to all the people who traded with me!

This is a work in progress.

  next to KafraDesk.

- To cancel a memo while writing, click the Trash icon. Memo will be lost.
