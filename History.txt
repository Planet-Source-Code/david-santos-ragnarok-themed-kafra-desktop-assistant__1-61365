What's New
=============================
6/27/2005
-----------------------------
- Implemented proper screen snapping!
- UberRagButton Style renamed to Caption
- UberRagbutton width can now be modified!
  Also uses a resource control (included) to pool the images needed by the
  UberRagButtons in order to reduce memory consumption.

11/24/2004
-----------------------------
- Ouch.  Almost a year in development and nothing much really added to the project.
- Modified the RagButton control into the UberRagBautton control :)

  Basically, the old control only allowed button styles exactly like the ones used by ragnarok.
  It was OK for Rag-style apps, but lacked flexibility, and since it was based on Bitmaps,
  took a bit of space and memory.
  
  Now the UberRagButton uses a bitmap for the background.  The Style property is your standard Caption.
  You can set it during run time or design time.
   
  It's still limited in size, however.  It'd be nice if you could stretch it wider.
  Blitting code as used the RagList would be needed to stretch the bitmap.

- Snapping code needs work.  I need a more general method of snapping. And smart-stacking would be 
  nice as well.


7/19/04
-----------------------------
- More work on the snapping code

7/12/2004
-----------------------------
- Implemented basic Kafra Planner, Kafra Tools windows
  Planner will have alarm functions, date keeping, organizing...
  Tools will house accessory things...
- Added snapping to MemoPad, will snap to edges of screen, and to planner 
  and tools windows when within 10 pixels.
  (Buggy, snap-off does not occur unless acceleration is reasonably high (>10 pixels))
- Added movement limitation to Kafra, can't drag above taskbar anymore.

7/11/04
-----------------------------
- Modified MemoPad for a larger space for both Memopad and Storage area
- Added buttons "Memo" and "Close"

  (Use the Memo button to switch between the memopad and the Storage area.
   Memo button will be highlighted when memo mode is activated.)

- Removed shadows for MemoPad

7/5/2004
-----------------------------
After a two-month lapse....
- Fixed minor Windows XP Autorun/Always on top menu bug
  (Registry wasn't being read correctly.)


5/18/04
-----------------------------
- Added blink animations for Blossom and Jasmine (Sakura Edition only)
- removed ani.txt dependency


5/17/04
-----------------------------
- Removed RagButton dependency
- Fixed a bug where messages aren't deleted.
- Added shadows to dialog boxes 
- Fixed window transparency code, Kafra won't suddenly go transparent anymore.
  (thanks to vbaccelerator.com's wonderful tutorials on subclassing and layered windows)


5/13/04
-----------------------------
- Planning to remove Ragbutton.OCX.  Its a waste of memory to load all the button styles
  I'll just go the old method.
- Fixed up transparent region code to read from a resource. Handy thing, that.
  Kafra bitmaps are now also stored in the resource, instead of in an imagelist.
  I was hoping to reduce overhead, but memory consumption is still greater than 
  my wishful goal of 4MB
- Added window transparencies for all you Windows 2000 and XP users :) (buggy)


5/12/04
------------------------------
- (Sakura Edition only)
  First implementation of Kafra blink animations, only with Pavianne right now.
  The file ani.txt needs to be in the same directory (and don't mess with it!)
- MSCOMCTL.OCX is now a separate download
- Pregenerated transparent region support added, and now Kafra changes happen in the blink of
  an eye!


5/11/04
------------------------------
- Added blurb window notification at startup.
  May remove this if deemed unnecessary.
- Cleaned up the transparent region creation code.
  I didn't notice this bug until I added the blurb, when I noticed that the leading 
  (leftmost) edges were missing. This is why the Kafra outlines seemed to be a bit ragged.
- Added Option Explicit to code, in hopes of lowering the memory usage, but it still uses
  around 7 to 8 meg of RAM. This is gonna be my next target area, especially for those of
  you who are worried about how much RAM is used by a simple desktop toy.
- Added Ragnarok-stlye pill buttons.  These are implemented as an OCX, so you need the 
  RagButton.ocx file in the same folder as KDA

  You can also use RagButtons in your own Visual Basic Programs.  Just add the OCX as a
  Control in Project >Components >Control Tab >Browse


5/7/04
------------------------------
- KDA window dragging now works in XP! Hehehe.
  Actually, it was a little bug in the code.  The original code didn't pass
  the paramaters to SendMessage to pick up the window as Longs, because they weren't
  explicitly declared as Longs. After using the predefined constants WM_SYSCOMMAND
  and SC_CLICKMOVE, all went well.  
  
  Well, you learn something new everyday!

  Yes, I know I said I hated XP , but I'm now using it for software development and testing.
  Only because all you you people are using it! 

 
2/17/04
------------------------------
- KDA Sakura Edition now available!
  Thanks to Lance for extracting and sending me the pics!

- Was having some problems creating transparent regions for the new Kafra
  but finally saw and fixed the bug in the code.


2/2/04
------------------------------
- Some optimizations. KDA will save the memo database 
  only if a new memo was entered.


2/1/04
------------------------------
- Got the comodo patch and added the last(?) Kafra,
  which in the Philippines here is called Sampaguita.

- This release is still buggy.  It SEEMS to cause crashes 
  on my computer.  Memory seems to suddenly get all used up.
  Or maybe it's all the programs I'm running simultaneously.
  At any rate, if your computer crashes due to this program,
  don't blame me, you have been warned.

- Created a whole line of animated ragnarok cursors, and
  packaged them with this release.
  If you install these cursors in the KafraDesk folder,
  KDA will use them when she has the mouse. 


1/28/04
------------------------------
- Added the Ragnarok pointer cursor (not animated) and hand cursors
  (open and closed) to the pack for your personal use, absolutely
  free of charge. KDA now uses these icons when the mouse is over it.

- Kafra can be moved along the bottom of the screen if she's covering 
  something. Click and drag.

- Dropping an item on the kafra will also store the item in the current 
  path.

- Lots of bugfixes.  Should be ready for a real release now!


1/27/04
------------------------------
- Added Kafra names. Thanks to Hentai Master for the info!

- Fixed Kafra randomize code to make sure next Kafra isn't the same one

- Added MSCOMCTL.OCX to make sure you have the right version installed

- Added Ragnarok cursors.  Very small because I'm using 64 x 64 icons.
  I can't make real 32 x 32 cursors with their hot spot offset to the top left.


1/24/04
------------------------------
- Added nifty icons to storage folder

- Made storage folder more like file browser. Folders are 
  opened in storage, not in a new window.

- Added system tray icon. seems a bit off-color

- Changed buttons to Ragnarok-style.

- Added proper close and minimize buttons. Top left button now
  pops up extra menu.

- All kafra images are stored again in the application, so we 
  only need one file.  Reason for excessive file size before
  was because the images were BMPs in 24-bit color format.
  Total file size now down to 470KB

- Added Registry based autorun, set via the right-click menu

- little tweaking here and there


1/15/04
-----------------------
- Added storage folder. Dropping files/folders into the storage box 
  will move them into the Kafra's Storage directory.  No way to move 
  them out yet. Can open folders, most associated files, links to 
  applications.  Links to folders don't seem to open at all.


1/13/04
-----------------------
- Converted images to gifs and had them loaded externally.  Program now 
  uses less space. Loading time for a kafra seems slightly slower.  
  If only there was a way to save and load regions directly into memory.


1/13/04
-----------------------
- Pretty simple and straightforward.  From some downloaded code for 
  creating non-rectangular forms, I edited it to support multiple 
  images, and faster region creation.

- Added memopad function via a Ragnarok-style popup form.
